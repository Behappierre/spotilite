# 🚀 Git Repository Setup for SpotiLite

## 📋 Overview

This guide will help you set up a Git repository for your SpotiLite project. Since we're currently in a Docker environment where Git isn't available, you'll need to run these commands when you're back in your normal Windows environment.

## 🎯 What We've Prepared

I've created several files to make the Git setup process as smooth as possible:

- **`setup-git.bat`** - Windows batch file for easy setup
- **`setup-git.ps1`** - PowerShell script for setup
- **`.gitignore`** - Properly configured Git ignore rules
- **`README.md`** - Comprehensive project documentation
- **`LICENSE`** - MIT License for the project
- **`PROJECT-SUMMARY.md`** - Detailed project overview

## 🚀 Quick Setup (Recommended)

### Option 1: Use the Batch File (Easiest)

1. **Open Command Prompt** in your project directory
2. **Run the setup script**:
   ```cmd
   setup-git.bat
   ```
3. **Follow the prompts** and instructions

### Option 2: Use PowerShell

1. **Open PowerShell** in your project directory
2. **Run the setup script**:
   ```powershell
   .\setup-git.ps1
   ```
3. **Follow the prompts** and instructions

## 🔧 Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up Git manually, here are the commands:

### 1. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
git init
```

### 2. Add All Files
```bash
git add .
```

### 3. Create Initial Commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: SpotiLite - Minimal Spotify Search with Full Playback"
```

### 4. Set Up Remote Origin
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/spotilite.git
```

### 5. Push to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## 📁 Files That Will Be Committed

The following files are ready to be committed to your Git repository:

- ✅ `index.html` - Main application file
- ✅ `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- ✅ `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- ✅ `README.md` - Project documentation
- ✅ `setup.md` - Setup instructions
- ✅ `generate-certs.js` - SSL certificate generator
- ✅ `LICENSE` - MIT License
- ✅ `PROJECT-SUMMARY.md` - Project overview
- ✅ `setup-git.bat` - Git setup script
- ✅ `setup-git.ps1` - PowerShell setup script
- ✅ `GIT-SETUP.md` - This file

## 🚫 Files That Won't Be Committed

The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude:

- `node_modules/` - Dependencies (should be installed with npm)
- `*.pem` - SSL certificates (generated locally)
- `.env` files - Environment variables
- Build outputs and temporary files

## 🌟 Next Steps After Git Setup

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com)
   - Create a new repository named `spotilite`
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Update Remote URL**
   - Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username
   - Example: `https://github.com/johndoe/spotilite.git`

3. **Push to GitHub**
   - Run `git push -u origin main`
   - Your code will be available on GitHub!

4. **Share Your Project**
   - Share the GitHub repository URL
   - Others can clone and contribute to your project

## 🔍 Verifying the Setup

After running the setup scripts, you should see:

- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ All files added to staging
- ✅ Initial commit created
- ✅ Repository status showing clean working directory

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Git is not recognized"
- Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
- Restart your command prompt after installation

### "Permission denied"
- Run Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator
- Or check your Git credentials configuration

### "Remote origin already exists"
- Remove existing remote: `git remote remove origin`
- Add new remote: `git remote add origin [your-url]`

## 🎉 Congratulations!

Once you've completed the Git setup, you'll have:

- A fully functional Spotify web application
- A professional Git repository
- Comprehensive documentation
- Ready-to-share project on GitHub

Your SpotiLite project is now ready for the world! 🎵✨
